## Project Overview
This project focuses on asynchronous functions in Python, covering topics such as:
- `async` and `await` keywords
- Asynchronous I/O operations
- Concurrency with asyncio

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Henry4593/alx-backend-python.git
cd alx-backend-python/0x01-python_async_function
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Python scripts to see asynchronous functions in action:
```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

## Files
- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: contains an asynchronous function that waits for a random delay.
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: runs multiple coroutines concurrently
and returns their results in a sorted list
- `2-measure_runtime.py`:  measures the total execution time for wait_n(n max_delay), and returns total_time / n
- `3-tasks.py`: contains a function that creates an asyncio Task.
-`4-tasks.py`: contains an asynchronous function that runs multiple tasks
concurrently and returns their results in ascending order.
